                    <h6 class="sub-header"><b>RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTHCARE – Increasing quality and accessibility to reach everyone, everywhere.</b></h6>
                    <p class="sub-header">As medical students and future doctors, in as much as we strive to be fully abled in providing high quality healthcare, we must understand that access to healthcare services is stratified. Over half of the world’s people are currently unable to obtain essential health services. Not everyone is able to exercise their deserved right to healthcare. Healthcare delivery must be ideal, equitable and unbiased. Like many other African countries, healthcare in Ghana becomes less and less accessible, the further a person is from the center of urbanization. For this reason, the chosen theme for the African Regional Meeting, 2018 in December is RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTHCARE – Increasing quality and accessibility to reach everyone, everywhere.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub-header">The theme for the meeting is in line with the WHO’s theme for this year which is “Universal Healthcare for All – Everyone, Everywhere”. According to WHO, universal health coverage is about ensuring all people can enjoy quality primary healthcare services, where and when they need them, without suffering financial hardship and discrimination, leaving no one behind. There are varying approaches to which universal healthcare coverage can be achieved by a nation, especially attending to the ample factors that contribute to unequal healthcare coverage.        
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub-header">We focused on Rural and Remote Healthcare because it is one of the main arms of unequal healthcare distribution in Ghana as well as many other African countries. Participants at the African Regional Meeting, 2018 in December will be asked to think, debate, reflect and discuss what it means for health services to be truly universal and how it relates to various stakeholders, including the roles of the government, community leaders, the media, health personnel and medical students as part of the greater group. More specifically, the states of rural healthcare, capacity building and knowledge on how to promote rural health will be included. We have selected four sub-topics to further explore;</p>

                            <li>The Pre-Regional Meeting will have a 3-day workshop dedicated to rural and remote healthcare. Sessions will be tailored to a smaller group of participants and will be very dynamic.</li>
