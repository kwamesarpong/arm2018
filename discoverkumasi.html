                    <i class="sub-header">Visiting Ghana without going to Kumasi is like visiting France without going to Paris. You didn’t get to see the Eiffel Tower, so it’s very likely your breath wasn’t taken away.</i>

                    <h6 class="sub-header"><b>Kumasi: the cultural heartbeat of Ghana.</b></h6>
                    <p class="sub-header">Kumasi is home to a people who are extremely proud of their roots and culture. Culture here is expressed through language, passage rites, festivals, food and ordinary day to day activity. The Ashanti culture speaks extravagance, unity, hospitality, peace, brotherhood and love. In the heart of the city lies the Manhyia Palace, home to the Asantehene. It's said that a golden stool descended from heaven and fell into the lap of Osei Tutu, who subsequently became the realm's first leader (Asantehene). The current Asante king is actually a direct descendant of Osei Tutu, and the fact that he not only still lives in Kumasi, but is considered by many locals to be a more important figure than the President, tells you all you need to know about how relevant the Ashanti culture remains today.  </p>

                    <p class="sub-header">A perennially green city, Kumasi gets a lot of rainfall and fresh air. It’s no surprise we have so many escape routes to nature. The city boasts of the only natural lake in Ghana, Lake Bosomtwe, the site of an ancient impact crater from a meteor speculated to be over 1 million years old. A gorgeous and peaceful spot, you can choose to enjoy the fishing, canoeing, swimming, or just bathe in the beautiful scenery.</p>

                    <p class="sub-header">Another place to sit back and take a break from the busy city life is the Rattray Park. A relatively new attraction in Kumasi with an artificial lake, a golf cart, children’s playground and a 6 square meter psychedelic fountain, making it the ideal location to enjoy the perfect day.</p>

                    <p class="sub-header">Visit the Boabeng Fiema Monkey Sanctuary, home to about 700 dazzling monkeys. The monkeys are protected and seen as sacred by those in the nearby villages, so they are used to being fed and interacted with. So if you pass by, indulge them. You’d be surprised at the result.</p>
                    <p class="sub-header">Just outside of Kumasi lies the Owabi Wildlife Sanctuary. This secondary forest surrounds a sizable reservoir and attracts a variety of wildlife, most notably some 160 species of birds. The reservoir is also of interest as it serves as the source of Kumasi’s water.</p>
                    <p class="sub-header">Explore the Bobiri Forest reserve as well, which houses the only Butterfly Sanctuary in West Africa with over 400 species of butterfly. A rare eco-tourism site, it is an undisturbed rainforest with lush tree species that provide a cool canopy cover. This reserve is ideal for nature lovers seeking a world away from this one.</p>

                    <p class="sub-header">In the 18th century, Okomfo Anokye planted a sword saying, the Ashanti Empire would come to an end if anyone removed the sword. Over three hundred years after, that sword still remains in the ground and can be found at a hospital named after him: Okomfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. The mysterious sword has invited many tourists to Kumasi, but no one has been able to pull it out of the ground. In 1964, when Muhammad Ali visited Ghana, he tried to pull it out, but he couldn’t. Machines have also been used, but to no avail. Maybe you could be the one to pull it out, but I doubt you’d want to be the cause of an empire’s end, would you?</p>

                    <h6 class="sub-header"><b>Discover the art and history of the Kente Cloth</b></h6>
                    <p class="sub-header">Kente is a colourful Ghanaian traditional fabric which is worn mostly on important occasions and celebrations. Kente was developed around 17th Century A.D by the people of the Ashanti Kingdom; it can be traced to the long tradition of weaving in Africa, dating back to circa 3000 BC. The origin of Kente is grounded in both legend and history. Now Ghana’s national cloth, kente is one indigenous handicraft that has won worldwide recognition. There are many types of Kente each with its own symbolism and name, which tells the history, culture and social practice of the weavers of the cloth.</p>
                    <p class="sub-header">Kente is used not only for its beauty but also for its representational value. The weaver derives the name and meaning from moral values, oral literature, philosophical concepts, human behavior, individual achievements, animal life, proverbs and social code of conduct. The town of Bonwire, a suburb of Kumasi, is where the kente cloth is woven. The natives are skilled at what they do and they will not hesitate to tell you all the stories behind kente. You might also be allowed to weave your own kente cloth.</p>

                    <h6 class="sub-header"><b>Do you love food? Then Kumasi loves you already!!</b></h6>

                    </div>
                    <br />

                    <p class="sub-header">It is said that if an Ashanti man hasn’t eaten fufu, then he hasn’t eaten for a whole day. Fufu with light soup or groundnut soup, ampesi and palaver sauce, banku and grilled tilapia are all staples of the Kumasi diet. The majority of meals enjoyed in Kumasi consist of thick, well-seasoned stews and soups, usually accompanied by foods such as rice, boiled yams, fufu and others. Local eateries, referred to as “Chop bars” by the locals are the ideal places to get sumptuous tasty homemade local foods.  Several restaurants can also be found in the city, serving a variety of dishes, both local and international. One amazing thing is that, no matter the time of the day, there is always a “chop bar” in a corner ready to serve your favourite meal.</p>
